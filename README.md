## Introduction:
The project consists of two dashboards (Sales & Customer) built using Tableau to help stakeholders, including sales managers and executives to analyze sales performance and customers.The objective of this project is to create a comprehensive dashboard for Superstore's sales performance. The dashboard aims to provide insights into sales, profit, and quantity metrics, allowing stakeholders to easily compare current year (CY) and previous year (PY) performance. Additionally, the dashboard offers detailed geographic sales analysis and customer performance metrics, facilitating data-driven decision-making. It will help marketing teams and management to understand customer segments and improve customer satisfaction.

## Sales Dashboard | Requirements

## Design & Interactivity Requirements

**Dashboard Dynamic**
- ► The Dashboard should allow users to check historical data by offering them the flexibility to select any desired year.
- ► Provide users with the ability to navigate between the dashboards easily.
- ► Make the charts and graphs interactive, enabling users to filter data using the charts.

**Data Filters**

Allow users to filter data by product information like category and subcategory and by location information like region, state and city.

## Lets's Know how I fulfilled these requirements 
- **Data Import and Relationship Creation**         
  Imported four datasets: Customers, Location, Orders, and Products. Established relationships between these datasets to ensure seamless data integration and accurate analysis.

- **Understanding Client Requirements**   
  Collaborated with the client to understand their specific needs and requirements.

- **Create Calculated fields and Parameters**

   ► Created a '**Select Year**' parameter to enable dynamic filtering of data based on the selected year.
  ![Parameter](https://github.com/mohd-muddassir99/Walmart-Sales-Performance-Analysis/assets/153819384/fd0db11c-b5d4-4e84-807f-5ac3b3f9530f)


 Some Calculated fields like:
 
**1. CY Measures :-**

        ► CY Sales = IF YEAR([Order Date]) = [Select Year] THEN [Sales]
        ► CY Profit = IF YEAR([Order Date]) = [Select Year] THEN [Profit]
        ► CY Quantity = IF YEAR([Order Date]) = [Select Year] THEN [Quantity]
        ► CY Customers = IF YEAR([Order Date]) = [Select Year] THEN [Customer ID]
        ► CY Orders = IF YEAR([Order Date]) = [Select Year] THEN [Order ID]
        ► CY Sales Per Customer = SUM([CY Sales])/COUNTD([CY Customers])

**2. PY Measures :-**

       ► PY Sales = IF YEAR([Order Date]) = [Select Year]-1 THEN [Sales]
       ► PY Profit = IF YEAR([Order Date]) = [Select Year]-1 THEN [Profit]
       ► PY Quantity = IF YEAR([Order Date]) = [Select Year]-1 THEN [Quantity]
       ► PY Customers = IF YEAR([Order Date]) = [Select Year]-1 THEN [Customer ID]
       ► PY Orders = IF YEAR([Order Date]) = [Select Year]-1 THEN [Order ID]
       ► PY Sales Per Customer = SUM([PY Sales])/COUNTD([PY Customers])

**3. % Difference Calculation Compare to PY :-**

       ► % Difference Sales = (SUM([CY Sales]) - SUM([PY Sales ]))/SUM([PY Sales ])
       ► % Difference Profit = (SUM([CY Profit]) - SUM([PY Profit]))/SUM([PY Profit])
       ► % Difference Quantity = (SUM([CY Quantity]) - SUM([PY Quantity]))/SUM([PY Quantity])
       ► % Difference Customers = (COUNTD([CY Customers]) - COUNTD([PY Customers])) / COUNTD([PY Customers])
       ► % Difference Orders = (COUNTD([CY orders]) - COUNTD([PY orders])) / COUNTD([PY orders])
       ► % Difference Sales Per Customer = ([CY Sales per Customer] - [PY Sales per Customer]) / [PY Sales per Customer]

**4. Min/Max Calculation :-**

        ► Min/Max Sales = IF SUM([CY Sales]) = WINDOW_MAX(SUM([CY Sales]))
                          THEN SUM([CY Sales]) 
                          ELSEIF SUM([CY Sales]) = WINDOW_MIN(SUM([CY Sales])
                          THEN SUM([CY Sales]) END  

        ► Min/Max Profit = IF SUM([CY Profit]) = WINDOW_MAX(SUM([CY Profit]))
                           THEN SUM([CY Profit])
                           ELSEIF SUM([CY Profit]) = WINDOW_MIN(SUM([CY Profit]))
                           THEN SUM([CY Profit]) END

        ► Min/Max Quantity = IF SUM([CY Quantity]) = WINDOW_MAX(SUM([CY Quantity]))
                             THEN SUM([CY Quantity])
                             ELSEIF SUM([CY Quantity]) = WINDOW_MIN(SUM([CY Quantity]))
                             THEN SUM([CY Quantity]) END

        ► Min/Max Customers = IF COUNTD([CY Customers]) = WINDOW_MAX(COUNTD([CY Customers]))
                              THEN COUNTD([CY Customers])
                              ELSEIF COUNTD([CY Customers]) = WINDOW_MIN(COUNTD([CY Customers]))
                              THEN COUNTD([CY Customers]) END 

        ► Min/Max Orders = IF COUNTD([CY orders]) = WINDOW_MAX(COUNTD([CY orders]))
                           THEN COUNTD([CY orders])
                           ELSEIF COUNTD([CY orders]) = WINDOW_MIN(COUNTD([CY orders]))
                           THEN COUNTD([CY orders]) END

        ► Min/Max Sales Per Customer = IF [CY Sales per Customer] = WINDOW_MAX([CY Sales per Customer])
                                       THEN [CY Sales per Customer] 
                                       ELSEIF [CY Sales per Customer] = WINDOW_MIN([CY Sales per Customer])
                                       THEN [CY Sales per Customer] END

- **Designing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**  
  Developed KPIs for Total Sales, Total Profit, Total Quantity Sold, Total Customers, Total Sales Per Customer and Total Orders in the Current year & previous year in **Line Chart**. Calculated the percentage change for these KPIs compared to the previous year.


- **Visualizations**
    
    - **Dual Axis Bar Chart** : Created a **Dual Axis Bar Chart** with sub-categories to compare CY and PY sales and profit.
    - **Sales and Profit Trend** : Designed a **Line Chart** to visualize sales and profit over time, including an average line for easy comparison.
    - **Geographical Sales Map** : Developed a **Map Chart** to display sales geographically, using color to represent sales volume. To go deep dive I added a **Bar Chart** in the tooltip to show sales by cities.
    - **Customer Distribution** : Designed a **Bar Chart** with parameter to show the distribution of customers in Current Year.
    - **Top 10 Customers** : Designed a **Matrix Table** to show the **Top 10 customers** with '*Customer Name*', '*Last Order Date*', '*CY Profit*', '*CY Sales*' and '*Count of Orders by Customer*'.

- **Dashboard Designing** :   
  Create an interactive Tableau dashboard that visually represents **Walmart Sales Performance** and added a drill-down feature (*drill down button*) in the **Sales Dashboard** to navigate to the **Customer Dashboard**.
